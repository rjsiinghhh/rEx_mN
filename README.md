Rexmn... or MERN stack is a simple project I picked up on Christmas night while I was waiting for Santa Claus to deliver my presents. SMH, I've been sitting next to my fire place for the past 4 hours... In all seriousness the reason behind this project is to further my knowledge and use what I learn from here and apply it to my Zamora Project. I already know a lot and have used these four pieces extensively in my own work and on many projects, but you def can never get enough practice!!!!! Before I change the world with my own work, I wanted to follow along to someone else's process in dealing with this stack.
