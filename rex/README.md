Rexmn... or MERN stack is a simple project I picked up on Christmas night while I was waiting for Santa Claus to deliver my presents. SMH, I've been sitting next to my fire place for the past 4 hours... In all seriousness the reason behind this project is to use the knowledge I learn from here and apply it to my Zamora Project. React is a strong suit, and I have a lot of experience with Express, Node, MongoDB, but you can never get enough practice!!!! Before I change the world with my work, I wanted to follow along to someone else's process in dealing with this stack. This is a code along from a udemy course online!!!
